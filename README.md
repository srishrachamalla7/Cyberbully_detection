# Cyberbullying Tweet Recognition Project



## Introduction

This project aims to develop a cyberbullying tweet recognition system using machine learning techniques. The project includes data preprocessing, model building, and a user-friendly web application built using Streamlit.

## Features

- Data preprocessing including text cleaning, tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
- Model training using Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) for cyberbullying tweet detection.
- Streamlit web application for user interface.
- Prediction of cyberbullying content based on user input.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/srishrachamalla7/cyberbullying-recognition.git
   cd cyberbullying-recognition
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- `models/`: Includes saved model files after training.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and preprocessing.
- `app.py`: Streamlit web application for user interaction.
- `train_model.py`: Script for model training.
- `preprocess.py`: Functions for data preprocessing.
- `utils.py`: Utility functions used across the project.

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app using the command mentioned above.
2. Input a tweet in the app.
3. The app predicts whether the input tweet contains cyberbullying content or not.

## Future Scope

- Enhance model performance by experimenting with different algorithms and hyperparameters.
- Include more advanced text processing techniques.
- Extend the web app with more interactive features and visualizations.
